# About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Konstantin, I live in Russia, Moscow ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º. Iâ€™m the CEO of [**SHEVELEV**](https://shevelev.agency) and the creator of the [**Rise**](https://github.com/wotkad/rise) project. I also work on a number of other open source projects, mostly in the JavaScript ecosystems.

I find myself most passionate about helping people learn about technology and how it can help improve their process and workflows. I like to do so through software projects that are well designed, tested, performant, and maintained in a way that advocates for great experiences for all involved.

These days I'm happily mixing it up and focusing on open source and the web. Would love to hear what you're up to, too!
